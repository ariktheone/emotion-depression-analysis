## Project Overview

This project offers a holistic approach to emotion and depression analysis by combining traditional ML techniques with DL and NLP. It collects user responses via an interactive questionnaire, computes normalized emotion scores, and predicts depression risk using both a weighted scoring algorithm and a neural network. The project also provides detailed visualizations and a downloadable report, making it suitable for both personal insights and academic research.



## Key Features

- **Interactive Questionnaire:** Collects data on various emotional states via intuitive Streamlit sliders.
- **Emotion Scoring:** Normalizes responses and calculates weighted emotion scores.
- **Depression Risk Prediction:**
  - **Weighted Method:** Custom risk assessment based on key emotional indicators.
  - **Neural Network:** Utilizes a Keras model (pre-trained or built on the fly) to simulate depression risk predictions.
- **Dynamic Visualizations:** Displays results using Plotly charts (bar, pie, and line graphs).
- **NLP Integration:** Processes textual input for sentiment analysis to provide additional insights.
- **Custom UI:** Incorporates custom CSS styling and animated elements (via Lottie) for an engaging user experience.



## Architecture & Design

The project is structured into multiple functional modules that work together to provide a comprehensive analysis. The architecture leverages data collection, feature engineering, model inference, and data visualization components.

## Project Components

### Dashboard

- **Questionnaire Section:** 
  - Users adjust sliders to rate different emotional states (e.g., Joy, Sadness, Anxiety, etc.).
  - Responses are normalized and used to calculate emotion scores.
  
- **Visualization:**
  - **Bar Chart & Pie Chart:** Visualize emotion distribution and scores.
  - **Line Chart:** Simulates weekly depression risk trends.
  
- **Personalized Feedback:**
  - Based on calculated weighted depression risk, the dashboard offers tailored advice and warnings.

### Deep Learning Model Integration

- **DL Model Loading:**
  - Tries to load a pre-trained Keras model (`model.h5`). If unavailable, it builds a simple neural network architecture.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis:**
  - Provides an NLP interface where users can enter text describing their emotional state.
  - Simulated inference gives a depression risk percentage based on text analysis.
