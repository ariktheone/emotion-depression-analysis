# Advanced Emotion & Depression Analysis

An advanced application integrating deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze emotions and assess depression risk. Built using Streamlit for an interactive dashboard, Plotly for dynamic visualizations, and TensorFlow/Keras for the DL model.

## Project Components

### Dashboard Features

#### Questionnaire Section
- Users adjust sliders to rate different emotional states
- Responses are normalized and used to calculate emotion scores

#### Visualization Components
- Bar Chart: Visualize emotion distribution
- Pie Chart: Emotion score breakdown
- Line Chart: Simulated weekly depression risk trends

### Deep Learning Model Integration

#### Model Characteristics
- Attempts to load pre-trained Keras model (model.h5)
- Builds a simple neural network if no pre-trained model is available
- Provides NLP interface for text-based emotional state analysis

## Model Preparation

### Neural Network Architecture

**Input Layer**:
- Accepts a feature vector of six emotion scores

**Hidden Layers**:
- Dense layers with ReLU activation
- Dropout for regularization

**Output Layer**:
- Sigmoid function for depression risk probability

### Model Compilation

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(6,)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(
    optimizer='adam', 
    loss='binary_crossentropy'
)
```

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-depression-analysis.git
cd emotion-depression-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the application
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. Navigate through the interactive dashboard
2. Complete the emotion questionnaire
3. Analyze personalized insights
4. Review depression risk assessment

## Future Work
